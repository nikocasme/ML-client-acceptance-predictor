# Decision Tree Classifier Project

This repository contains code for a machine learning project that uses a Decision Tree Classifier to predict client acceptability based on various attributes.

## Overview

The project includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, evaluation, and visualization steps. It demonstrates the use of pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib for data analysis and machine learning tasks.

## File Structure


## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>

# You may need to install seaborn and matplotlib if you haven't already
pip install pandas scikit-learn seaborn matplotlib

## Run the code:
If using Google Colab:
Open the notebook my_code.py in Google Colab.
Execute the cells in the notebook.

## If running locally:
Ensure you have the AAA.xlsx dataset in the same directory as the code.
Run the Python script my_code.py in your Python environment.

# Results
The code provides various analyses and visualizations, including:

* Descriptive statistics for different columns in the dataset.
* Correlation analysis between features and the target variable.
* Distribution plots, pair plots, and box plots for visualizing data distributions and relationships.
* Handling missing values and standardizing data.

## Usage
Modify the code as needed for your own dataset or use case.
Experiment with different machine learning algorithms, preprocessing techniques, or hyperparameters.
Extend the project by adding more analyses, visualizations, or additional features.
